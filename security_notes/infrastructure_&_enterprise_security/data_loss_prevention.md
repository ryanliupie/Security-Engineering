### What is DLP (Data Loss Prevention)?

DLP is a set of tools or security solution that identifies and helps prevent sensitive data from being shared, transferred or used. As organizations grow such as adopting cloud infrastructures and remote work models, protecting sensitive data becomes more complex. 

Leakage of sensitive data (such as PII, PHI) can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory fines. 

### Types of DLP 

- <b>Network DLP:</b> Monitors activity and traffic across on-premise and cloud environments. This includes tracking of emails, messages, and file transfers. It maintains a database of access logs tracking the movement of sensitive data. It allows the security teams to determine whether data is at rest or in transit. 

- <b>Endpoint DLP:</b> This monitors endpoints such as servers, laptops, desktops, mobile devices, and cloud repositories (S3 Bucket). Note an endpoint is not limited to physical devices, rather a system that accepts network connections, be authenticated, receive/store/serve data, and can be a target for an attack. 

- <b>Cloud DLP:</b> This is specific for organizations that store data in cloud environments. This type of DLP encrypts and scans sensitive data before stored in the cloud, and keeps track of authorized cloud applications and users. 

### Causes of Data Leakage 

- <b>Exfiltration:</b> Unauthorized access of a network usually through a phishing or DDoS attack. Adversaries have different intentions on why they want to steal data such as financial gain, power, war, etc...  

- <b>Insider Threats:</b> Employees or contractions have access to data in which they may intentionally or unintentionally compromise data security. 

- <b>Negligence:</b> Data breaches often stem from human errors, poor security procedures, or a lack of access restrictions. The need for the POLP helps minimize this risk.
