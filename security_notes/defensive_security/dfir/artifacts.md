## What are Artifacts? 

Artifacts are tracks that get left behind, such as footprints when walking in the snow, where that person/user is unaware of it. 

As technology evolves, people become more dependent on it. This leads to increased data storage, downloads, and newer methods of data sharing. 

With this in mind, there are a wide variety of digital artifacts such as logs, files, and metadata. These components significantly help an investigation. We will a look at some of the top computer artifacts: 

### 1. Computer Artifacts of execution

These are artifacts that show a program or process was indeed ran by the user. There are some different locations where you can find this: 

- <b>LNK files</b> - These are shortcut (`.lnk`) files which are created by the Windows operating system whenever a user executes a file. It contains information suc has the path to the file and the timestamp of execution.

- <b>Prefetch files</b> - This is another Windows artifact which are system files (`.pf`) typically located in `C:\Windows\Prefetch`. They are designed to speed up a launch of an application by caching the necessary data for frequently used programs. 

    - These files contain run count (how many times the application was run), up to the last 8 run times, application timestamp, and the file path.
