### What is Telemetry? 

This term refers to the process of gathering and analyzing data from sources, including networks, applications, endpoints, cloud environments, and other sources to gain visibility into an IT department. This is especially useful in cybersecurity as it can help identify security threats and give a broad picture on the entire attack surface. 

### Specific Sources

- <b>Endpoints:</b> This includes any networked connected device such as mobile phones, servers, and workstations. 

- <b>Cloud Environments:</b> This can include public and private clouds an organization uses and the associated logs. 

- <b>SaaS Applications:</b> Any common web-based applications such as Gmail, Outlook, Microsoft tools, and more. 

- <b>Firewalls:</b> Any firewalls such as a WAF or a layer 3 firewall
