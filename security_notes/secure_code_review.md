    Imagine you and your family are going on vacation, but securing your home is not a priority. You may leave doors unlocked, windows open, or even the garage ajar‚Äîcreating multiple entry points for intruders to steal valuable items. Similarly, insecure code leaves applications exposed to cyber threats.

    This is why writing secure code is essential, especially when handling confidential and sensitive information. Implementing security best practices from the start helps protect systems, data, and users from potential breaches.S
