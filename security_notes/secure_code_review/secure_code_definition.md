## What is Secure Code? üåê

 Secure coding is the practice of developing software with a strong emphasis on security. By writing secure code, developers can minimize vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of attackers exploiting a system or service. 
 
 Imagine you and your family are going on vacation, but securing your home is not a priority. You may leave doors unlocked, windows open, or even the garage open, creating multiple entry points for intruders to steal valuable items. Similarly, insecure code leaves applications exposed to cyber threats.


 This is why writing secure code is essential, especially when handling confidential and sensitive information. Implementing security best practices from the start helps protect systems, data, and users from potential breaches.
