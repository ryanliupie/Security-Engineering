### What is Telemetry? 

This term refers to the process of gathering and analyzing data from sources, including networks, applications, endpoints, cloud environments, and other sources to gain visibility into an IT department. This is especially useful in cybersecurity as it can help identify security threats and give a broad picture on the entire attack surface.

### Specific Sources

- <b>Endpoints:</b> This includes any networked connected device such as mobile phones, servers, and workstations. 

- <b>Cloud Environments:</b> This can include public and private clouds an organization uses and the associated logs. 

- <b>SaaS Applications:</b> Any common web-based applications such as Gmail, Outlook, Microsoft tools, and more. 

- <b>Firewalls:</b> Any firewalls such as a WAF or a layer 3 firewall 

- <b>Identities:</b> This includes all users and applications that are identity-based, from email logins, to single-sign-on(SSO), to IAM tools such as Microsoft Active Directory or AWS IAM. 

- <b>Security Logs:</b> This can be from EDR, XDRs, MDRs, Antivirus, and more.

### Observability vs. Monitoring vs. Telemetry 

<b>Observability:</b> The ability to assess a system's state in a given time period based off specific data. This allows an organization to understand the state of their IT infrastructure. Is everything okay? What needs to improve? 

<b>Monitoring:</b> This is more so keeping an eye telemetry sources for specific behaviour and events. 

<b>Telemetry:</b> Now this is the data itself an the automated process of collecting and transmitting data.

### How does Telemetry work with Threat Intelligence? 

Telemetry provides real-time information into an organization and threat intelligence provides context into known adversaries. For instance, threat intelligence can help determine known malicious IP addresses and if telemetry picks up those IP addresses, it will be easier to shut them down.
