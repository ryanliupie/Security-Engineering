## What is Threat Modeling? 

Threat modeling is the process of identifying threats, and weaknesses against a system, application, or network. 

Believe it or not, it is something that humans naturally do everyday. For example, turning left at the lights. You have to aks yourself: 
- Are there pedestrians crossing? 
- Is there incoming traffic ahead? 
- Is the light still green/turning yellow/turning red? 
- Is it safe to turn? 
- Are you turning fast enough to not get hit?

### Threat Modeling Framework

This framework helps us organize threat modeling which consists of the following:

- <b>Assess Scope:</b> What are working on? It could be a large system, or small system. We have to understand the assets, value of them etc..

- <b>Identify what can go wrong:</b> What are the threats to the system? How much money would a company lose if a threat exploited "x"? This is where you brainstorm everything that can go wrong. 

- <b>Identify countermeasures:</b> Once these threats are identifed, what are you going to do about them? This may involve approaching approaches to risk management such as accepting the risk, transfer or mitigate it; if this system participates is high risk activites, it may be time to avoid them. 

- <b>Assessing work:</b> Did you do a good job? What went well/wrong? What can you do to improve next time? It is important to assess your solutions because if this happens again, you know what to do and how to make them more efficient and stronger.
