### What is Threat Intelligence? 

This refers to the collection, processing, and analysis of data to understand a threat actor's attack methods, motives, and targets. This allows security teams to make data-driven decisions taking a proactive approach rather than a reactive approach. By understanding many different types of attack mechanisms, organizations can bolster their defenses by predicting future threats. 

### APT

An <b>APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)</b> is a well-rounded stealthy Adversary that infiltrates a network to steal data, spy, disrupt operations, remaining hidden for long periods of time. They are often composed of experienced cybercriminals that target high-value organizations. As well as, they are usually well-funded, leading to more sophisticated attacks. 

### Threat Intelligence Classifications

- <b>Strategic Intelligence:</b> This is high-level information about the changing risk landscape. This is geared toward high-level management or Executives to understand the potential cyber threats on business objectives. 

- <b>Tactical Intelligence:</b> Tactical intelligence contains detailed information about adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and common attack paths. It focuses on how attacks are carried out and which techniques are most commonly used, rather than on attribution or motivation. Tactical intelligence helps security engineers, detection engineers, and incident response teams understand how attacks work so they can design effective security controls, write or refine detection rules, and improve defensive processes.

- <b>Operational Intelligence:</b> Operational intelligence provides time-sensitive awareness of active or emerging attack campaigns. It focuses on what is happening right now, including which techniques are currently being abused and which types of organizations or environments are being targeted. Operational intelligence is used by SOC managers, incident response teams, and security engineers to prioritize defensive actions, prepare response efforts, and mitigate ongoing threats. While it may reference indicators or alerts, its primary value is the context and urgency it provides rather than raw IOCs. 

- <b>Technical Intelligence:</b> Technical intelligence consists of low-level, highly actionable artifacts that can be directly consumed by security tools and monitoring systems. This includes indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, signatures, URLs, and detection rules. Technical intelligence focuses on what should be blocked, detected, or flagged immediately and is primarily used by SOC analysts, automated security controls, and detection platforms (e.g., SIEM, EDR, firewalls). Due to its highly volatile nature, technical intelligence has a short lifespan and must be continuously updated to remain effective.
