# Security-Engineering-Notes

<hr>

<p> 
    Based on a lot of research and testing in the cyber security field, becoming a security engineer is what I want to do. This is a broad term as you can do anything as a security engineer but I am interested in how attackers attack a system and how I can develop automation scripts to detect and mitigate them. 
</p>
<p> 
    This will be a long journey as there is much to learn. Down below I have created notes based off of AWS's technical competencies, grace nolan's notes, and also my personal notes.
